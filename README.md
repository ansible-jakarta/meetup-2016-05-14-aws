# ** Deploying Network & Server Infrastructure in AWS using Ansible **
Hello all, this is the repository for Ansible meet-up Jakarta - 14 May 2016.

We will assume that the reader are using Linux / Mac OS X operating system. All of the scripts in this repository will also help the reader to setup Ansible quickly.

### ** *Background* **

When we want to deploy our server infrastructure, most of the case it will not be just about server / machine that hosts our application. To address the need to scale in a distributed system, there are lot of things that we need to care about, especially our **network & server infrastructure**. A good architected infrastructure will give us a lot of benefits starting from agility, security, and scalability not only for addressing our current needs but for anticipating future needs.

AWS is a cloud platform from Amazon that can help us on building the right things that scale. In this demo, we will learn on how to create a network & server infrastructure in AWS by leveraging Ansible.
